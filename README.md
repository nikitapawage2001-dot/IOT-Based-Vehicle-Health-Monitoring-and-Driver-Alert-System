# 🚗 IoT Based Vehicle Health Monitoring and Driver Alert System Using CAN

A comprehensive **real-time embedded and IoT-based system** designed to monitor vehicle health parameters and driver safety conditions using an **automotive-grade CAN communication network** and **cloud-based alerting**. The system enables real-time monitoring, fault detection, and proactive alerts for improved safety and reliability.


## 📋 Overview

This project presents a real-time Vehicle Health Monitoring and Driver Alert System designed to enhance vehicle safety and reliability. The system continuously monitors engine operating conditions and driver hand presence on the steering wheel, processes the data locally, and communicates it using an automotive-grade CAN protocol.

Engine-related parameters are analyzed in real time to detect abnormal conditions, while the driver alert mechanism identifies unsafe driving behavior such as removing hands from the steering wheel. The processed information is displayed locally on a TFT display and simultaneously transmitted to the cloud for remote monitoring.

An event-driven alert mechanism generates email notifications whenever predefined safety thresholds are exceeded, enabling early fault detection and proactive response. The overall system follows a scalable, reliable, and automotive-style architecture, making it suitable for real-world vehicle monitoring and driver safety applications.
